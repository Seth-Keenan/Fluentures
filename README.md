# Fluentures 🐪
*Oasis-themed language learning app by Team camelCase for Mizzou's Senior Capstone course.*

Leave the days of route memorization behind and take your learning journey on an adventure through the desert with Fluentures. Explore and advance your horizons by creating new Oases on your Map. Each Oasis is your own word list with your own words to learn. Visit your Oasis to learn your words with one of four learning features. Edit and favorite words anytime. The learning features are enhanced with AI to create a natural learning experience, encouraging you to learn words in a natural sense, just like if you were immersed in the language. There are also Social Features and a Logbook (user statistics) to keep you enganged and on course.
